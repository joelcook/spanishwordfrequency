I've been learning Spanish off and on for a lifetime now. One of the best resources I've found is Fabulaudit's video series on YouTube: [Spanish Comprehensible Input Course for Absolute Beginners!](https://youtu.be/8FmT4sIdZx0?si=45iIKNGb96NDy135)\

Fabulaudit not only created a fun and engaging story for Spanish learners, but he also provides a transcript for each video so you can read and follow along if you'd like!

If you're learning a foreign language, you'll find that some words are used more frequently than others. Like me, you might want to study those most frequently used words.

This project collects all the stories Fabulaudit made and ranks the most frequent words.
